			<h2>Lab 3 Advantages</h2>
			<p>During the last few weeks, my Partner Noctis and I have gradually gained a deeper understanding of JavaScript.
				<br>At the beginning of the semester, neither of us knew how to use JavaScript because the online classes we had been taking had caused us to learn less efficiently
				<br>and I hadn't learned much useful knowledge during the online classes,
				<br>so I decided to work hard this semester to learn and thus change my status quo.
				<br>During this semester, the two of us are also friends in our lives, which makes it easier for us to communicate and at the same time have more time to complete our assignments.
				<br>Sufficient time helps us to learn JavaScript better.

			<h2>Lab 3 Difficuties</h2>
			<p>We likewise had a lot of difficulties in our studies, and although we had a lot of time to complete our assignments,
				<br>at the same time each of us had a lot of other subjects' assignments to complete this semester,
				<br>which led to times when we got together to write assignments for other subjects as well.
				<br>For me personally, I worked in the school dining hall this semester and was so physically and mentally exhausted that there were times when I wasn't very efficient at writing assignments.
